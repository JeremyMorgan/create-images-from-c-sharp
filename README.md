# Creating Images from C#! 

A simple demo to create images from C# with OpenCV and the Emgu Wrapper. 

This is some code from a [Live Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkFeAwxoBCw) that I did where we generated some jpgs from C#. 

There's nothing fancy or amazing here, but this is the code we wrote.
